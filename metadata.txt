name= Processing Workflows
description=A plugin that adds workflow functionality to Processing.

about= 
	Plugin for QGIS Processing Toolbox for creating processing workflows and workflow collections. Workflows provide step-by-step instructions and guidance for less experienced users thus facilitating capacity building in Earth observation data analysis and GIS tasks.
	
	This plugin is part of the Water Observation Information System (WOIS) developed under the TIGER-NET project and GlobWetland Toolbox developed under the GlobWetland Agrica project. Both projects were funded by the European Space Agency as part of a long-term initiative aiming at promoting the use of Earth Observation (EO) for improved Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) and environmental monitoring and reporting in Africa.
